# Portfolio Viewing Guide

## 🎯 You Have TWO Different Portfolios

### 1. **Static HTML Portfolio** (with all the new enhancements)
**Location:** `c:\Users\user\Desktop\portf\portfolio2\index.html`

**How to view:**
- Simply **double-click** `index.html` in File Explorer
- OR right-click → Open with → Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- OR use Live Server extension in VS Code

**Features:**
- ✅ All 25+ motion graphics enhancements
- ✅ Magnetic cursor effect
- ✅ Particle trails
- ✅ Holographic cards
- ✅ Liquid animations
- ✅ All advanced CSS effects

**Files:**
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `css/style.css` - Enhanced CSS (2065 lines)
- `js/main.js` - Enhanced JavaScript (1211 lines)

---

### 2. **React Frontend Portfolio** (dynamic, connects to backend)
**Location:** `c:\Users\user\Desktop\portf\portfolio2\frontend-portfolio\`

**How to run:**
```bash
cd frontend-portfolio
npm run dev
```

**Features:**
- Connects to backend API
- Dynamic content from database
- Admin dashboard integration
- **Does NOT have the motion graphics enhancements yet**

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

The **motion graphics enhancements** I just added are ONLY in the **static HTML portfolio** (`index.html`).

If you want these enhancements in the React version too, you would need to:
1. Copy the CSS from `css/style.css` (lines 1442-2065)
2. Copy the JavaScript from `js/main.js` (lines 743-1211)
3. Integrate them into the React components

## 🐛 API Error Fix

I fixed the 500 error in your React frontend. The issue was:
- **File:** `frontend-portfolio/src/services/api.js`
- **Problem:** React Query was passing the query context object as a parameter
- **Solution:** Removed the category parameter from `getProjects` function

The error is now fixed. Restart your React dev server to see the changes.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If you don't see the effects:**

1. **Check you're viewing the right file**
   - Make sure you opened `index.html` (not the React app)
   - URL should be `file:///` or `localhost` (not port 5173)

2. **Clear browser cache**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

3. **Check browser console**
   - Press `F12` to open DevTools
   - Look for any errors in Console tab

4. **Verify files are loaded**
   - Check Network tab in DevTools
   - Ensure `style.css` and `main.js` are loaded
